# Predict Fuel Efficiency with Machine Leaning

## Objective
Develop a machine learning model to predict the miles per gallon (mpg) of a car for given car features such as the number of cylinders, engine displacement, power produced by the engine, acceleration, weight of a car, and model year as well as deploy the model to Amazon Web Services (AWS).

## Content
* `Data` contains data set used to train and test algorithm.
* `templates` contains index.html for web page.
* `server` contains model pickle file and server.py developed by using Flask.
* `Fuel_Efficiency_Prediction.ipynb` is a python code for developed model.

  
## Steps Performed

* Collected the data from Kaggle.
* Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to find out outliers and relationships between the variables/features.
* Performed hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV to find the most suitable model with optimal parameters for the given problem.
* Build a web application using Flask.
* Deployed the web application on an Amazon Web Services (AWS) EC2 instance.
